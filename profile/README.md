# Fair Crypto Foundation

## Mission

Fair Crypto Foundation aims to empower the individual in navigating the evolving world of cryptocurrencies through understanding of the first principles of Crypto. In our view, the first principles of Crypto are self-custody, transparency, trust through consensus, and permissionless value exchange without the counterparty risk as originally envisioned by Satoshi's white paper.
Through research, development and community building, we aim to create more economic freedom defined as one's ability to direct their own economic energy without hindrance of centralized control systems.

## Founder

The Fair Crypto Foundation concept has been devised by @mrJackLevin, an open source technologist and an early Google Engineer (â€˜99-05) and developed by a small group of partners - professionals in computer science, communications, software and product development, marketing and investments. The Foundation's goal is to carry out its vision through education, organization and launched Blockchain Projects embodying the first principles of Crypto.
